**Recognizing tidy data

For data to be tidy, it must have:

Each variable as a separate column.
Each row as a separate observation.
As a data scientist, you'll encounter data that is represented in a variety of different ways, so it is important to be able to recognize tidy (or untidy) data when you see it.

In this exercise, two example datasets have been pre-loaded into the DataFrames df1 and df2. Only one of them is tidy. Your job is to explore these further in the IPython Shell and identify the one that is not tidy, and why it is not tidy.

**Reshaping your data using melt

Melting data is the process of turning columns of your data into rows of data. Consider the DataFrames from the previous exercise. In the tidy DataFrame, the variables Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp each had their own column. If, however, you wanted these variables to be in rows instead, you could melt the DataFrame. In doing so, however, you would make the data untidy! This is important to keep in mind: Depending on how your data is represented, you will have to reshape it differently (e.g., this could make it easier to plot values).

In this exercise, you will practice melting a DataFrame using pd.melt(). There are two parameters you should be aware of: id_vars and value_vars. The id_vars represent the columns of the data you do not want to melt (i.e., keep it in its current shape), while the value_vars represent the columns you do wish to melt into rows. By default, if no value_vars are provided, all columns not set in the id_vars will be melted. This could save a bit of typing, depending on the number of columns that need to be melted.

The (tidy) DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded. Your job is to melt its Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns into rows. Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to bring this melted DataFrame back into a tidy form.

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'])

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())

**Customizing melted data**

When melting DataFrames, it would be better to have column names more meaningful than variable and value (the default names used by pd.melt()).

The default names may work in certain situations, but it's best to always have data that is self explanatory.

You can rename the variable column by specifying an argument to the var_name parameter, and the value column by specifying an argument to the value_name parameter. You will now practice doing exactly this. Pandas as pd and the DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded for you.

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'], var_name='measurement', value_name='reading')

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())
